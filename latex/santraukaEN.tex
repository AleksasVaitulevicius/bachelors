In the last two decades, there was a growing interest in dynamical graphs, because of their use in such fields like: communication network, VLSI design, graphics. This work is only about dynamical graph problem, maximum flow, one of the most fundamental optimization problems. The main task of this work is to prove that provided algorithm for solving maximum flow problem is more efficient than Ford Fulkerson algorithm for static graph in the context of used edges for calculation. This algorithm is based on modified clustering method and modified Ford Fulkerson algorithm. Clustering method is used for clustering graph into clusters and modified Ford Fulkerson algorithm is used for computing maximum flows in particular cluster. Positioning and capacity of clusters will be saved in memory. Once updated clusters are computed, it is possible to find maximum flow for the whole updated graph. \\
Keywords: dynamic graphs, max flow, clustering, Ford Fulkerson algorithm, heuristic experiments.
