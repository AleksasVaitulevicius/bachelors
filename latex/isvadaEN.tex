Result of this work is implementation of algorithm, developed in course work, and performed empirical experiments. Additionally, the developed algorithm was improved and algorithm's weakness was determined.

Performed empirical experiment results concludes that formal prove of correct algorithm performance is useless. As the developed algorithm finds correct maximum flow only of specific networks, which can be clustered into clusters, which has route to sink of the network, by using clustering function. Moreover, the developed algorithm is not more efficient than Ford Fulkerson algorithm, which is used to find maximum flow in static networks. In conclusion, even if the algorithm was adapted to find maximum flow in all networks by changing clustering function, the developed algorithm would still be unimportant.
